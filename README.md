# Sales-analysis-powerbi
This is my sales analysis  Power BI dashboard. I took raw data and turned it into clear, actionable insights. Built from scratch data modeling, DAX formulas, interactive visuals. The goal: make metrics easy to read and decisions easy to make. Straight to the point. No noise. Just data that talks.
